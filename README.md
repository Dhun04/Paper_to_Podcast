# Paper_to_Podcast
Paper to Podcast converts research papers into multilingual, human-like audio using NLP and TTS models. Our Streamlit dashboard allows users to upload papers and download podcasts in MP3 format, enhancing research accessibility. Future plans include summarization, dialogue-based podcasts, and a mobile app.
